00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Start off by downloading the template off bootstrap.com.
2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:16.100
The Template you downloaded should look like this.
3
00:00:016.200 --> 00:00:25.100
First lets edit the Title of the website!
4
00:00:025.200 --> 00:00:30.100
Make it whatever you want of course 
5
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.100
Next edit the menu bar
6
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:45.100
Type in whatever you would like between the <a> tags (hyperlink tags).
7
00:00:045.200 --> 00:01:06.400
They must be <a> tags in order to be clickable and to navigate to where you want it to go
8
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.100
Next up lets change the background image of the header!
9
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100
For this particular template you can change it through the CSS file
10
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.400
Just find the class it's under and change it with your picture, simple!
11
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:34.100
Next up you have to delete the text thats inside the section.
12
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.300
It should look something like this after you're finished up.
13
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:50.800
Now we are going to change the title for the "Who am I" page
14
00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:07.800
Next delete the excess code because you won't be needing it.
15
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.300
Also delete the <i> tag, you also won't be needing that!
16
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:36.300
Put your image tag and make the class as "card" - this makes it into a rectangular card.
17
00:02:036.400 --> 00:03:12.300
Fill out all the necessary information to make it look pretty and aligned! Also pick a width or height you like!
18
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:43.300
Fill out your description - I used an <h4> tag to make a small little title and a <p> tag for the body
19
00:03:43.400 --> 00:04:28.600
Make an <a> tag and class it as a button (btn) in order to link whatever you want.
20
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.400
Your "who am i" page should look similar to this format
21
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:40.200
Now when editing the skills page you want to have an <img> tag and a <p> tag for the description.
22
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:50.200
For me all i did was just copy and paste my first example and then just change the image and description. 
23
00:04:50.300 --> 00:05:00.400
You can also edit the images and text more in the css if you would like.
24
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:13.400
Delete this section of the page since you won't be needing it.
25
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.200
To make a contact me page all you have to do is is edit the title, change the description
26
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:34.200
In my case i deleted the telephone part. Also you must change the email of course!
27
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:47.700
That concludes the tutorial, it should look similar to this in the end!
